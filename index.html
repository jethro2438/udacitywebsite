		  <div class="description">
				<p>I have made this website because I love seeing pictures of paradise
				like conditions all over the world. I know that someday soon this
				scripture will be fullfilled and the whole earth will become a
				paradise again just as God has promised in Revelation 21:3, 4.
				"With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: Look! The tent
				of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be
				his people. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out
				every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will
				mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed
				away." If you are interested in learning more about all of Gods
				wonderful promises, please visit <a href="https://www.jw.org"

				<p>I hope you enjoy my website. I am very excited to get into the
				world of programming. It has been a dream of mine since I was a kid.
